#The objective of this program is to create a simple way to automate CentOS VMs using libvirt, virt-install, and kickstart. 
#Much of the script is still very messy and unique to specific environments (designed for homelabs). Good working knowledge of libvirt, virt-install, kickstart, python, bash, and virsh will make it possible to make this work with any environment.
